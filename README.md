 Rip courses from Fireship (without an account)?!

 Instead of scraping, you could also just clone the fireship.io repository and parse the .md files, but I like to scrape.

 Please support Fireship by buying [PRO](https://fireship.io/pro) or sponsoring [codediodeio](https://github.com/sponsors/codediodeio).

 This repository is for educational purposes.
